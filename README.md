# ROck
 This is a very simple bot for my discord server in python. Using the DIscord.py library. It has various functions. Currently the bot code is very messed up and I have not used cogs yet, I wrote it in a single file. I will update my code in the future and also use proper comments. This is my first repo in github and my first contribution. I hope you all like it and support me.
